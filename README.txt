Management tools for climbing routes.

== Description ==

Alpha Version - Route management for climbing and boulder gyms.

Things may change on the way to first stable version 1.0.

1. Extract the Plugin to a `climbpress` Folder

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there developer documentation? =

Not yet, but I'm working on it.

= Can I use my own grading system? =

As I know that a lot of climbing gyms use own climbing scales, it is possible to add custom scales. There is currently no interface for that and has to be done right in the database. An interface for that will be provided shortly. Till then ask your developer or contact me for more information on how to do that.
